# WordPress Email Integration
The email feature in WordPress is crucial for effective communication and user engagement. WordPress websites often require communication with users for various purposes, such as user registrations, password resets, email notifications, and contact form submissions. WordPress on App Service has been integrated with [Azure Email Communication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/email/email-overview) service to enable email feature

The email Integration with WordPress on Azure AppService can be achieved in 2 ways:
1.	Newly created sites:  Email integration is enabled and configured out of the box
2.	Existing WordPress sites:  It needs an explicit integration setup as per the steps outlined below.  

## 1.Configuring Email with New WordPress Websites
Follow the steps to create a new WordPress website here: [How to set up a new WordPress website on Azure App Service - Microsoft Community Hub](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure-blog/how-to-set-up-a-new-wordpress-website-on-azure-app-service/ba-p/3729150)

To enhance the user experience, we have enabled email support for all the SKUs (Basic/Standard/Premium) by default.

As a default option, we offer an Azure managed domain for sending emails from WordPress sites. This seamless integration allows you to easily send emails without the need for additional setup.
