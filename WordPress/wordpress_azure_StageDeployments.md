# WordPress on Azure App Service - Stage Deployments

Azure App Service Deployment Slots are a feature of Azure App Service that allow you to create multiple deployment environments for your web applications. They are extremely useful for various scenarios, such as:

- Development and Testing: You can have separate slots for development, staging, and testing your web app without affecting the production environment. This allows you to validate changes before making them live.

- Blue-Green Deployments: You can set up a production slot and a staging slot. When you're ready to release a new version, you can swap the slots, making the staging slot the new production slot. This enables zero-downtime deployments.

- A/B Testing: You can create multiple slots to test different versions of your application with a portion of your user base, allowing you to gather feedback and make informed decisions.

- Rollback: If a new deployment causes issues, you can easily swap the slots back to the previous version, quickly rolling back changes
