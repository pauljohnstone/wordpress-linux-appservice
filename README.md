# WordPress on Linux App Service

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/WordPress.WordPress)

Whether youâ€™re shuffling a couple thousand visitors a day through an eCommerce shopping experience or attracting thousands of visitors to your content per day, your digital experience must be available and load fast to engage and wow your audiences. Our cloud-based solutions give your sites high availability, speed, scalability, and security, so you can press ahead with confidence.

WordPress hosted on Azure App Service is a fully managed Azure PaaS offering with built-in infrastructure maintenance, security patching and scaling. It also supports virtual networks, and the ability to run in an isolated and dedicated App Service Environment. WordPress updates and patches as described [here](https://github.com/Azure/wordpress-linux-appservice/blob/main/WordPress/wordpress_auto_updates.md), threat detection and blocking, and traffic encryption with free SSL certificates are part of what we offer to all of our customers.

There are several forms of WordPress running on Azure, but we recommend [WordPress on Azure AppService](https://aka.ms/linux-wordpress) from the Azure Marketplace as your start point. Because these Marketplace offerings are optimized for Linux App Service, they are designed to be easy-to-install and come with up-to-date software packages, fine tuned SKU sizes for both App Service & [Azure Database for MySQL Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/flexible-server/overview) and also with support from App Service team.

WordPress on Azure App Service is supported in Public cloud, US Government clouds(Fairfax) & China Cloud(mooncake).

## Image Details
Image Server URL: https://mcr.microsoft.com

URL to view all the list of WordPress tags:  https://mcr.microsoft.com/v2/appsvc/wordpress-alpine-php/tags/list

|Image Name |Image Tag  |OS |PHP Version | Nginx version| 
|-----------|-----------|---|------------|--------------|
|appsvc/wordpress-alpine-php    |latest <sup>(see note)</sup> |Alpine Linux 3.16  |8.0.30  |1.24.0 |
|appsvc/wordpress-alpine-php    |8.0 |Alpine Linux 3.16  |8.0.30  |1.24.0 |
|appsvc/wordpress-alpine-php    |8.2 |Alpine Linux 3.19  |8.2.15   |1.24.0 |
|appsvc/wordpress-alpine-php    |8.3 |Alpine Linux 3.19  |8.3.2   |1.24.0 |

**Note**: *latest* tag corresponds to 8.0 version of PHP, and it does not actually mean that it will always carry the latest version of image. We will soon stop using the *latest* tag and use appropriate 'numerical' tag to avoid confusion.
